    <h1>JavaScript functions</h1>
    <h2>How do they work?</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript functions are blocks of code that can be defined and then
      called later. They can take in parameters and return values. Functions can
      be declared in two ways: as a function declaration or as a function
      expression. Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they can be called
      before they are declared. Function expressions are not hoisted, so they
      must be declared before they are called.
    </p>
    <h2>Function Declaration, the old way</h2>
    <code>
      //funtion + name + parameters <br />
      function add(num1, num2) { <br />
      // Where the stuff happens <br />
      // Gives output of the sum of the two numbers<br />
      return num1 + num2;<br />
      }
      <br />
      // Print out what 5 + 10 is <br />
      console.log(add(5, 10));
    </code>
